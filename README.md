#  Vegam - Online Fuel Delivery Management System

**Vegam** is a Java-based application that simulates an online fuel delivery management system. It integrates **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with **JDBC and MySQL** to manage customer orders, assign drivers based on availability, and prioritize deliveries based on payment amount.

-  Add Drivers (stored in MySQL)
-  Add Customer Orders (stored in MySQL)
-  Prioritize deliveries based on payment amount (using `PriorityQueue`)
-  Assign drivers dynamically if available
-  Uses DSA + JDBC for real-world logic simulation
-  Full user inputâ€“based system via terminal

#  DSA Concepts Used
- PriorityQueue: To ensure high-paying orders are delivered first.
- HashMap / ArrayList: For efficient driver lookups and assignments.
- OOP Concepts: Encapsulation, abstraction, modular design.
