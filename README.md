# 🚛 Vegam - Online Fuel Delivery Management System

**Vegam** is a Java-based application that simulates an online fuel delivery management system. It integrates **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with **JDBC and MySQL** to manage customer orders, assign drivers based on availability, and prioritize deliveries based on payment amount.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+)
- MySQL
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- DSA Concepts:
  - PriorityQueue (Heap)
  - HashMap / ArrayList
  - Custom Classes & OOP Principles

## 🔧 Features

- 🚗 Add Drivers (stored in MySQL)
- ⛽ Add Customer Orders (stored in MySQL)
- 🔝 Prioritize deliveries based on payment amount (using `PriorityQueue`)
- 👨‍✈️ Assign drivers dynamically if available
- 🧠 Uses DSA + JDBC for real-world logic simulation
- 📥 Full user input–based system via terminal

# 🧠 DSA Concepts Used
- PriorityQueue: To ensure high-paying orders are delivered first.
- HashMap / ArrayList: For efficient driver lookups and assignments.
- OOP Concepts: Encapsulation, abstraction, modular design.
